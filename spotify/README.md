# Spotify
This folder isn't really dots but is all the Extensions, Themes, and Custom Apps. There also is a folder contenting prefs files for base Spotify that to my understanding will only auto apply if your using my Spotify account but you can also just copy and paste the files into your user DIR.

## Prefs files
really isn't much just have crossfade by default 3 sec, don't boot on start, and don't stay in tray.
