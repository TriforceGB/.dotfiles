# Personal dotfiles

Here is where I stow all my personal dotfiles I use. Most are based on premade dots from someone else (Such as Nvim) or only the the edited I've made to the original dots so that I can update them without having to majorly edit mine (end-4 hpyr dots). Credit to the original dots can be found in each folder with a link to each project.

## Stow

These dots are formated to be used with GNU Stow. Stow Creates Symlinks to different location depending on the tree created in the orgininal folder. Stow also don't like removing existing Dots so make sure to delete/backup old Dots before using Stow. for more information on Stow just go to there website and install it with your package mananger of choice.

## Uses

To uses these dots files make sure you have the folder located in your home directory then use the stow command with the name of the right file

```bash
stow <name>
```
